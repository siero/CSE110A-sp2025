### Welcome to **CSE110A:** _Fundamentals of Compiler Design_, Spring 2025 Quarter at UCSC!

- **Instructor:** [Marcelo Siero](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=msiero2)
- **Time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays:  05:20 - 06:55 PM
- **Location:** Stevenson Acad 175

Hello and welcome to the fundamentals of compiler design class! 

In this class you will learn about compiler design and implementation. In the abstract, compilers explore many 
of the [foundational problems in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). In practice, 
compilers are [massive pieces of well-oiled software](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTg3OTQ), 
and are some of the engineering marvels of the modern world. 

For numerous years we have experieced health issues and extreme weather conditions. Our first priority in this class 
is your health and well-being. We will approach any challenges that arise with compassion and understanding. 
I expect that you will do the same, both to the teaching staff and to your classmates. 
We will follow university guidelines and will work together to have a productive and fun quarter.

This class is scheduled to be _in person_. Learning outcomes will definitely suffer if you do not attend lectures.  
We may post lectures online for extra study materials, but you should not expect this to be an equitable substitute 
for in-person attendence (e.g. these do not capture discussions well, and occasionaly the equiptment has errors). 
If your situation requires asynchronous courses, I suggest you contact an undergraduate adviser to discuss 
alternative options.

Thanks to [Professor Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/) 
and [Professor Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) 
for the great template and for a lot of the content of this class!
